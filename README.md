# LEAF - Lightweight Example of Agave's Functionalities

Hi! I am Liam(Min), and I recented graduated in December with a major in Mathematics/Computer Science. Since February, I have been working as an Analyst in a Venture Capital. While I am enthusiastic about learning macroscopic IT landscape and products, I also love to build products from the ground up as an individual contributor. You can reference my resume for more details on my background and experiences.

Discovering Agave, I was intrigued by both the product and technical perspectives, and felt compelled to be part of your missionary team as a software developer.

As with my favorite idiom "actions speak louder than words" goes, I created a simple web app basesd on Agave’s tech stack. The app is comprised of the following components.

- **Frontend:** JavaScript + React
- **Backend:** PHP + Laravel
- **Infrastructure:** AWS EC2 + Apache Web Server + PostgreSQL

I present to you LEAF, a simple CRUD application accessible through http://3.12.73.155/. Although I do not have prior experience with PHP + Laravel, and the requirements specifically mentioned candidate do not not require prior experience with the mentioned tech stack, I hope this project demonstrates my enthusiasm and capability to learn new technologies.

I have added Agave’s teammates as part of the user db, so you can access the website with the following user info:

- user: [first_name].[last_name]@leaf.com
- password: [first_name w/ first letter capped][last_name]123!

e.g)
- name: Min (first name) Choi (last name)
- user: min.choi@leaf.com
- password: Minchoi123!

There are a few deviations from the original stack. I used JavaScript instead of TypeScript because interface and type assertions worsened code readability, and the scale of my project did not incur type confusions. Additionally, I initially planned to implement a small-scale Agave API or Data Sync and utilize Redis for caching given its suitability for high-read, low-write scenarios. However, due to time constraints from my current full-time job, I decided not to implement the service, leaving Redis unnecessary for LEAF.

Agave intrigued me from the product perspective of 'reconstructing' the legacy IT infrastructure of the construction industry with the newest tech stack. I am excited about the opportunity to be part of the missionary team, building the product from zero to one as a software developer. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further.
